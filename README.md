# Bear-Samurai-Public
This is a public repository of bear samurai, my very first project. I put way more effort into it than was required. 

There are two bugs still left in this game. One lets you get infinite health, the other causes an IL and breaks the game. One of these is worth fixing.

I would love to add some little die rolling animations and such later. Maybe flesh it out a little more or add more to the start of the game before you are sent into the future. Maybe do a little Metroid thing where you lose your stats and kit when flung into the future. 

Hope you enjoy playing, if anyone actually finds this repo.  I put way more effort into this than I should have.
